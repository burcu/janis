Janis, the Missing Components of Android SDK
============================================
Janis aims to solve everyday problems by providing solutions for everyday problems by providing commonly needed features for existing components that are not presented in the official Android SDK. This library includes the following components:

Views
-----
* `LoadingImageView`: An image view you can set an remote image url.
* `LoadingListView`: A list view allows you to fire new loading actions once user hits the bottom of the list.
* `NotScrollingListView`: A list view that is growing in height depending on the number of the items on the list. This is a popular trick to put a ListView into a ScrollView, so ListView scrolling wont block its parent's.
* `NotScrollingListView`: Similart to `NotScrollingListView` but for constructing grid views.
* `AnimatedImageView`: Animates an array of drawables you set.
* `PagedScrollView`: A vertically scrolling view with paging enabled.
* `HortizontalPagedScrollView`: A horizontally scrolling view with paged enabled.
