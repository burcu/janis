Introduction
============
Android Utils aim to solve everyday problems by providing most common components that are not presented in the official Android SDK. This library includes the following components:

Views
-----
* `LoadingImageView`: An image view you can set an remote image's URL.
* `LoadingListView`: A list view allows you to fire new loading actions once user hits the bottom of the list.
* `NotScrollingListView`: A list view that is growing in height depending on the number of the items on the list. This is a popular trick to put a ListView into a ScrollView, so ListView scrolling wont block its parent's.
* `AnimatedImageView`: Recieves an array of drawables and animate them.
* `PagedScrollView`: A vertically scrolling view with paging enabled.
* `HortizontalPagedScrollView`: A horizontally scrolling view with paged enabled.
